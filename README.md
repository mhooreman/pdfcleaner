# pdfcleaner

Converts PDF by removing everything which is not inside the pages.

Some PDF are made by tools associated to a license, so that when the license is
expired, the content of the PDF is hidden. When the content of those PDF are
made by the end-user, we consider this as "legal ransomware".

In other words, such a practice doesn't allows the proprieraty of the
information contained in those document to have access to that information. In
terms of data ALCOA++ data integrity principles, it breaks the "Legible"
attribute.

We've gote such a case on critical PDF documents. The  was implemented as
an opaque rectangle on top of every page, which is hidden using JavaScript as
soon as the license is not expired.

The `pdfcleaner` tool converts PDF by only keeping the pages, which will drop
that ransomware practice.

## Installation

The tool is for now not published on PyPI. To install, download the latest
wheel from the github releases, and install it using pip.

For example: `pip install pdfcleaner-1.1.0-py3-none-any.wh`.

**Note:** this project is not yet distributed on PyPI.

We strongly recommend to run it in a dedicated virtual envionment, to avoid
potential conflict with other python scripts and libraries installed on the
system (python best practice). If you choose for this option, please see the
venv documentation.

## Supported python

Any CPython version starting from python 3.10 is supported: when issusing the
first version of the project, 3.8 and 3.9 were still supported by the python
foundation, but since we're taking benefits from python 3.10 new features, it
has been chosen to not support previous versions of the language.

No other python than CPython is officially neither supported nor tested ...
which doesn't means that it won't work with other implementations of the
language.

## Usage

You have to run the following script using the command line: `pdfcleaner`.

Invoking it with the help option (`pdfcleaner --help`) provides command line
usage.

**Note**
The entry points are configured in `[project.script]` inside pyproject.toml:
- `scriptname = "package.module:mainfunction"` or
- `scriptname = "package.module:Class.staticmdethod"`

## Development

### Project and environment

Development is managed using hatch. If you don't have it, it please go on
[the hatch installation web site](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/).

Project is configured in pyproject.toml.

From the command line, inside the repository root directory:

- To start an environment with all the required dependencies: `hatch shell`

- The script can be executed directly within that shell (an executable is created)

- The script can also be executed using hatch: `hatch run pdfcleaner`. This is
  more reliable on Windows than the `hatch shell` apporach.

- To create a build: `hatch build`

- To manage version:
    - `hatch version`: to display
    - `hatch version major`, `hatch version minor`, `hatch versoin patch`: to
      increase the corresponding part of the version number (semantic
      versioning)

### Code quality control requirements

All those requirements are enforced by configuration in `pyproject.toml` at the
root of the repository.

The decision to change any item of this configuration is left to the main
author of the package.

#### Code linting

Code linting is performing using the ruff linter provided with hatch.

It has been configured so that all the non-experimental controls are enabled,
with some specific rules diabled with good reason.

It shall be checked using `hatch fmt`.

#### Typing

All the methods and functions shall be typed, mypy strict checking is enabled.
Exceptions shall be documented using `# type: ignore` comment.

Typing of variables is optional. It becomes mandatory if required by mypy to
verify typing of methods and functions.

This shall be checked using `hatch run types:check`.

#### Code documentation

All the public features in the code shall be documented.

Documentation of private features is optional, and becomes required if
requested by [code linting](#code-linting).

It shall be checked using `hatch fmt`.

#### Unit testing

We target full decision coverage on all the supported python versions, but this
will be implemented through the new releases. At version 1.0.0, as least
modules import is tested through all the supported versions.

Unit testing with statement and decision coverage is executed by
`hatch test --cover`.

Unit testing on supported python version is executed by `hatch test --all`.

### Building

Make sure that the version number is up-to-date by either editing
`__about__.py` or by invoking `hatch version` accordingly.

The command `hatch build` builds the sdist and wheel packages. Those packages
will then eventually be attached to the github releases.

## Releases and changes

As soon as the version 1.0.0 is released, every development shall refer a
github issue. Upgrade to version minor or version major whall be made via a
change request.

Every release shall be developped in her own branch.

The main branch shall be updated, via a pull request, as the last step before
publication of the build.

The build shall be created on the upgraded main branch and published as a
github version. A corresponding tag shall be created.

## Reporting issues

Issues shall be reported via the project GIT repository's issues

Apart of those issues, the following limitations are known: None yet
